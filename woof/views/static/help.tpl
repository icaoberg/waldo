<h1>User Guide</h1>
<h2>User interface</h2>
<p>The web interface to waldo is very simple. You look up a protein and it
returns whatever its databases know about it.</p>
<h2>Programmatic interface</h2>
<p>Waldo can also be installed locally and programmatically queried. This is
more appropriate for heavy usage. Please download the Python package from <a
href="http://pypi.python.org/packages/waldo">PyPI</a> or <a
href="http://github.com/luispedro/waldo">github</a>.</p>
<p>After installation (with the standard <tt>python setup.py install</tt>), run

<pre>
update-waldo --user --unsafe
</pre>

to install the database.</p>
