<h1>About Waldo</h1>
<p>Waldo was developed at Carnegie Mellon University, by <a

href="http://www.cs.queensu.ca/~shatkay/">Hagit Shatkay</a>, and <a

<p>The goal is a unified interface to up-to-date subcellular location
information from protein databases. It can be accessed through a web-browser or
as a Python library.</p>
